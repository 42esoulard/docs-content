To use a storage device in Linux it must be mounted (attached) into the operating system. Once it is mounted, a filesystem can be created on the device to store data. 
To remove the device securely from the operating system, [unmount it](/storage/block/how-to/detach-a-volume) properly.

## How to verify device availability

1. Connect to your instance with `ssh`.
  ```
  ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
  ```

2. Use the `lsblk` command to make sure your block volume is available:
  ```sh no-code
  root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
  NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
  sda       8:0    0 23.3G  0 disk
  vda     252:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
  ├─vda1  252:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
  └─vda15 252:15   0  100M  0 part /boot/efi
  ```

You can see your block volume named `sda` with the chosen storage size.

  The Scaleway ecosystem uses [GiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte) to define storage sizes and not [GB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte) as the default on linux.

## How to format the Block Volume

If you do not know which file system to use, you probably want to use `ext4`.
```
root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda
```

Make sure your file system is correctly created by running the `lsblk -f` command.
```
root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk -f
NAME    FSTYPE LABEL UUID                                 MOUNTPOINT
sda     ext4         925c2c17-ca8c-493a-a9cd-b475d87fd276
vda
├─vda1  ext4   root  8509fe04-d91c-410a-9087-c5d34537d3ae /
└─vda15 vfat         B3E7-7040                            /boot/efi
```
Check if the `FSTYPE` field matches `ext4` for your Block volume.

## How to mount the Block Volume

Once your file system is created, you need to mount it.  

1. Create the mount point. In this tutorial, we choose `/mnt/block-volume`.
  ```
  root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# mkdir /mnt/block-volume
  ```
2. Mount the volume. It is recommended to use the `defaults` option:
  ```
       **defaults**
            Use  the  default  options: **rw**, **suid**, **dev**,
            **exec**, **auto**, **nouser**, and **async**.
  ```

  If you want to see all available options, you can run `man mount` on your instance.

  ```
  root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# mount -o defaults /dev/sda /mnt/block-volume
  ```

3. Make sure your file system is properly mounted by running the `lsblk` command.
  ```
  root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
  NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
  sda       8:0    0 23.3G  0 disk /mnt/volume-block
  vda     252:0    0 18.6G  0 disk
  ├─vda1  252:1    0 18.5G  0 part /
  └─vda15 252:15   0  100M  0 part /boot/efi
  ```

Check the `MOUNTPOINT` field.

## How to use fstab for Persistent Mounting

With the current configuration, the block device will not be mounted automatically upon reboot. Use the `fstab` file to make sure the reboot does not impact your file system.  

Add this line to the `/etc/fstab` file of your instance:

```
echo '/dev/sda /mnt/volume-block ext4 defaults 0 0' >> /etc/fstab
```
