# How to enable two-factor authentication (2FA)

You can enable two-factor authentication on your account for heightened security. Once enabled, an additional security code, generated by your phone, is required to access your account.
Two factor authentication provides an extra layer of security. As well as your password (the first factor), a second factor (the 2FA app) is required to gain access to your account. Even in case of a leaked password, your account is protected by this second layer of security.

1. Open the Scaleway [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net) in a web browser and log into it using your identifer and password.

2. Once logged in, click your user name next to _logged in as:_ in the top right corner of the console. Then click **Security** in the pop-up menu.

> **Note:** If your phone does not have a camera, you can manually enter the registration code shown in the console.

4. Open the authenticator application on your phone and scan the code using the application.

5. A registration code is displayed on your phone's display. Enter this code in the activation form and click **Enable** to validate.

Your account is now protected by two factor authentication, and a security token will be requested upon your next login.

> **Note:** Make sure to keep your authentication device secure as you can't log in without the 2FA security token.
