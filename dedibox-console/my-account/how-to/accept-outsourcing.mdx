If you have a Scaleway Dedibox account, another Dedibox user can give you access to their Dedibox dedicated servers and failover IPs by outsourcing them to you. Outsourcing allows you to manage the outsourced services without the need for full access to the other user's Dedibox account.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net) 

</Message>

Once the other user [sends you an outsourcing request](/dedibox-console/my-account/how-to/outsource-dedibox), you receive a notification to accept the incoming request.

1. Click the link in the outsourcing request email to open the Scaleway Dedibox console:

  <Lightbox

    width="600"
    alt=""
  />

2. The **Outsourcing** section of the Scaleway Dedibox console displays. Check the **Accept** box for the service(s) you agree to have outsourced to you:

  <Lightbox
    src="scaleway-dedibox-console-outsourcing-accept.png"
    width="600"
    alt=""
  />

3. Click **Save changes** to validate your choice.

The services are now outsourced and available in your console.
