# How to outsource a service ?

Outsourcing a dedicated server allows you to assign the technical management of your machines and services to another Scaleway Dedibox account without giving full access to your account.

Outsourced servers can be managed by a third party on your behalf. The other Dedibox account holder has access to all the technical details of your Dedibox but will not be able to view your billing information or to make changes to the services you have in your account.

If you have several machines, you can outsource each of them individually to different users, if required.

1. Log into your Scaleway Dedibox [Console](https://console.online.net).

2. Click **Server** > **Server list** in the menu at the top of the web page to display the list of your servers.

3. Select the server you want to outsource and click **Manage** to view its details.

4. Click **Outsourcing** in the side menu of your server's status page:

5. The outsourcing form displays. Enter the identifier of the new technical contact for your server. The identifier is the login of the other user's console account. Click **Send request** to validate the form.

The holder of the other account receives a notification to accept the outsourcing of your dedicated server into its Scaleway Dedibox account.
