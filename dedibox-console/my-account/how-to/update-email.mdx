2. Once logged in, click your user name next to _logged in as:_ in the top right corner of the console. Then click **Account information** in the pop-up menu.

3. The account information page displays. Click **Update** next to your email address:

A link will be sent to the email address registered in the account.

4. Click the link sent to your registered email address, to access the email update form.

5. Enter your new email address and its confirmation. Then click **Update my mail** to submit.
