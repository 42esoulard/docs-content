# How to revoke an existing outsourcing

Outsourced services are services which have a technical contact different from the service's owner. The technical contact (another Scaleway Dedibox account holder) is able to manage these services without needing to have full access to the owner's Scaleway Dedibox account.

The outsourcing of a service can be revoked at anytime by either the owner or the other Dedibox account holder.

1. Open the Scaleway [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net) in a web browser and log into it using your identifer and password.

2. Once logged in, click your user name next to _logged in as:_ in the top right corner of the console. Then click **Outsourcing** in the pop-up menu.

4. Click **Remove selected roles** to validate the form and revoke the outsourcing of the selected services.

The services disappear from the outsourced account and the technical role is reset to the owner of the service.

> **Note:** Revoking the outsourcing of a service does not cancel its subscription.
