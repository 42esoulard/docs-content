If you forget or lose the password to your [Scaleway](https://console.scaleway.com) account, several methods exist to regain access.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have a [Scaleway Elements](https://www.scaleway.com/en/elements) account

</Message>

## Passwordless Authentication Using a Magic Link

The [Magic Link](/console/my-account/how-to/sign-in-with-magic-link) allows you to access your account without a password, using two-factor authentication.

Click **Send a Magic Link** in the Login page of the Scaleway console.

A secret link is sent to your e-mail. You can access your account by clicking on the link.

## Password Reset Using Email Validation

If you forget or lose your password, you can request to reset it.

1. Go to the [lost password](https://console.scaleway.com/forgot-password) page of the console:

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-forgotten-password-screen.png" />

2. Enter your e-mail address and click **Reset my password**. A password reset link is sent to your e-mail address.

3. Click the link in the e-mail address to reset your password.

4. Enter your new password and click **Reset password** to set the new password for your account. You are redirected to the Login page.

5. Log in to the console by using your e-mail address and the newly set password.

## Password Recovery in Case of Lost Email Account

If you lose access to your e-mail account, it will not be possible to reset the password directly from the Scaleway console.

In this case, you must contact our dedicated Trust & Safety team by e-mail, providing the following documents:

  - Your Scaleway login (e-mail address)
  - Another **valid** e-mail address
  - Two different documents that prove your identity (passport or local ID card for individual accounts + incorporation certificate for companies)
  - A phone number to contact you on
  - Copy of your last Scaleway invoice or the amount of your last invoice if you do not have a copy of it
  - A card or bank account statement showing a Scaleway transaction.

Send these documents by e-mail to: <a href="mailto:document@scaleway.com">document@scaleway.com</a>

Your e-mail address will be updated upon receipt of the request, subject to validation.

Once your e-mail address has been updated, you can use this form to request a validation link by e-mail.

## Password Security Guidelines

Besides the usual guidelines you should follow to create a complex password (must contain UPPERCASE and lowercase letters, symbols (`@`, `$`, `&`, ...) and numbers), some basic rules exist to keep your password - and your account - safe:

  - Never give your password to anyone. Especially not via mail, IRC, Slack, Whatsapp, or any messaging system. Scaleway employees will never ask you for your password.
  - Use [two-factor authentication](https://console.scaleway.com/account/profile) to add an extra layer of security.
  - Do not write down your password.
  - Always log out from your account at the end of each session, or if you are away from your computer.
