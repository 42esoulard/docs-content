## RPN

Real Private Network (RPN) is a second physical network that uses a dedicated ethernet adapter to enable network coverage over all of Scaleway datacenters. You can create "RPN Groups" with different servers that are able to communicate with each other. Servers of different accounts can be in the same RPN group and each server can be in multiple groups. The RPN allows you to exchange internal data in a dedicated and secure network and without using the bandwidth of your Internet connection. "Jumboframes" with a MTU of 9000 are supported in the RPN.

## RPN SAN

The RPN SAN is a network attached storage providing additional storage for your Dedibox. The RPN-SAN Basic provides a cost-efficient way to extend your storage with HDD based storage. The RPN-SAN HA provides high-available storage, replicated intra-DC and is available in both, HDD based and SSD based storage for highest performances.

## RPN v2

RPN-v2 is a new version of Dedibox RPN Network (Real Private Network). It allows much more configuration, such as:

- Custom address plan inside a private VLAN
- Layer 2 Network
- No MAC address restriction
- Multicast

</Concept>

## RPN VPN

RPN VPN allows you to connect to your RPN group using a VPN. The VPN is based on OpenVPN to ensure easy configuration. You can add the VPN server to your RPN group as any other server.
Notably, it allows you to securely connect from anywhere in your private network as well as to connect servers which don't have a RPN interface to the RPN.

## VLAN

A virtual local area network (VLAN) is a logical group of workstations, servers and network devices that appear to be on the same LAN despite their geographical distribution. The purpose of implementing a VLAN is to improve the performance of a network or apply appropriate security features.

## VLAN ID

VLANs are identified by a VLAN ID (a number between 0 â€“ 4095), with the default VLAN on any network being VLAN 1. Each port on a switch or router can be assigned to be a member of a VLAN (enabling the receiving and sending traffic on that VLAN).
