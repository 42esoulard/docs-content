## Domain Name

A domain name is an unique alphanumeric name used to identify a computer (web or email server) on the Internet. It translates the numeric address of the computer to a more memorable name.

## DNS Zone

Computers connected to an IP network, for example the Internet, all have an unique IP address.
These addresses are numeric because it is easier to handle for a machine. With IPv4 these addresses have the form of xxx.yyy.zzz.aaa, where xxx, yyy, zzz and aaa are four numbers in the range of 0 to 255 (in the decimal system). Whilst these numbers are easy to handle for a computer, it is impossible for a human. Therefore a mechanism was deployed to associate an IP address with a more memorable name, called a domain name.
The DNS zone links these memorable names with their IP addresses.
If you want to connect to our website **www.scaleway.com**, your computer sends a request to a DNS server, hosting the DNS zone.
This is a file that has the information about the IP addresses linked to a domain name.

##TLD 

TLD is the acronym used for top-level domains. It is the last segment of a domain name after the final dot. The most common example is .com, but thereâ€™s a whole wide world of different TLDs.

## TLD specifications at Scaleway

Some TLDs have special requirements that can block you from ordering or renewing a domain. Registry may also ask for some verifications.

- .eu : the owner's postal address must be located within the European community. Following Brexit, the UK is no longer considered part of the European community https://eurid.eu/en/register-a-eu-domain/brexit-notice/
- .be : your authcode is only available directly from the registry. The phone number must be linked to the country declared in the postal address
- .de : administrative contact and technical contact must be an individual located within the European community
- .la : administrative contact and technical contact must be an individual
- .li : administrative contact and technical contact must be an individual
