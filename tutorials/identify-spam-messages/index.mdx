SPAM is the practice of sending automatic, unsolicited commercial messages through electronic messaging systems, to large numbers of recipients with the purpose of commercial advertising or with the intention of fraudulent attempts at obtaining sensitive information or data, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details.

Often times, senders of SPAM messages are able to fake the origin address of the e-mails they are sending. They are, therefore, able to fake their identity using the same domain name as a company uses with their e-mail addresses.

Let's picture a practical scenario. Imagine the marketing department of `www.example.com` (a fictional company) sends a few e-mails per month using the address `promotional_info@example.com`. A spammer with the intention of obtaining sensitive information might use the same origin address, which they were able to fake, in order to confuse the receivers of the message. If they use `promotion_info@example.com`, for example, many people might not notice the difference and entrust the sender with information they would entrust only to the `www.example.com` company.

  If you are currently being sent SPAM messages from an e-mail address ending with `@scaleway.com`, the sender has faked the e-mail address. Scaleway does not send SPAM messages or sell e-mail addresses to these senders.

In this guide we share some of the best practices and solutions to the problems of receiving SPAM.

## Where does SPAM come from?

To identify the origin of a SPAM message, open the e-mail headers and check the address its being mailed by (outgoing mail servers). If you see any mention of `online.net` in the header, the email was delivered through one of our mail servers. It does not mean that the email was send on behalf of Scaleway but passed through the mailbox of one of our customers.

You can see the IP address of the server originating the email in the [header of the email](https://documentation.online.net/en/web/web-hosting/tutorials/mail/recover-header-email). To verify if the server through which the e-mail was sent from belongs to a customer of Scaleway, verify the ownership in the [RIPE database (WHOIS)](https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/query).

## I have received SPAM from a domain name or IP address hosted at Scaleway

What do I do?

If you were able to verify the domain name or IP address is registered with Scaleway, you can open an [abuse complaint](https://console.scaleway.com/support/abuses/create) to alert the customer.

When you open the complaint, Scaleway will - by default - not show your email address to the customer in question, in order to protect your privacy. The customer has the possibility of giving their response on the complaint directly from their [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com). If the complaint is not addressed by our Trust&Saefty team monitors these complaints and will take the necessary measures will be taken in case the complaint is not handled accordingly by the customer.

If the IP address or the domain name where the SPAM messages are coming from is registered with another service provider, Scaleway can not act directly. You can file a complaint directly with the different providers to request that the website or email account are deactivated.

If you have further questions, please reach out to the Scaleway Trust and Safety team by contacting our assistance.
