## Container 

A container is a package of software that includes all dependencies: code, runtime, configuration, and system libraries so that it can run on any host system. Scaleway provides you with custom Docker images that are entirely handled for you in the cloud. With Containers, you can rely on your favorite technologies such as Django or Ruby On Rails.
