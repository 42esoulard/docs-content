## Container Registry

Scaleway Container Registry is a fully-managed mutualised container registry, designed to facilitate the storage, management and deployment of [container images](#container-image). The service simplifies the development-to-production workflow, as there is no need to operate your own container registry or to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

## Container Image

A Container Image is a file that includes all the requirements and instructions of a complete and executable version of an application. When running an image, it becomes one or multiple instances of that application. You can pull the image instructions, edit its settings, view its versions or delete it.

## Image Privacy Policies

Image Privacy Policies specify whether everyone has the right to pull that image or not. When an image is set to public, anyone is able to pull it. Set your image to private if you want to restrict access. You can also specify that an image should inherit its privacy policy from its namespace.

## Namespace

Namespaces allow you to manage your Container Registry in a simple, clear and human-readable way. A namespace is a collection of container images, each bearing the unique identifier of that namespace (each namespace must have a globally unique name). A namespace belongs to a user, who is responsible for configuring the push and pull permissions with [privacy policies](#namespace-privacy-policies).
