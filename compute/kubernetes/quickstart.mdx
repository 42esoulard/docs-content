Scaleway [Kubernetes Kapsule](/compute/kubernetes/concepts#kubernetes-kapsule) provides a managed environment to create, configure and run a cluster of preconfigured machines for containerized applications. This allows you to create Kubernetes clusters without the complexity of managing the infrastructure. You can create a Kapsule cluster to your required specifications, edit it after creation and delete it all when you no longer need it. You might also want to check out our how-to on [deploying an image on your cluster](/compute/kubernetes/how-to/deploy-image-from-container-registry).

2. Click **Create a cluster**. The first page of the cluster creation wizard displays.

3. This page concerns the configuration of your cluster. Enter the following information:
    * The **name** for the cluster and optionally a description:
    * The geographical **region** of the cluster
    * The Kubernetes **version** for the cluster
    * If required, configure **advanced options**, including the container network interface, the ingress controller, and cluster tags, which can help you to organize your cluster. Keep the default settings if you don't know what these values mean.

4. Click **Next**. The second page of the cluster creation wizard displays.

5.  This page concerns the settings for your pool. Enter the following information:
    * The **availability zone** in which all your pool's nodes will be created
    * The **node type** you require
    * The configuration for your **node options**, including the number of nodes and whether to enable autoscale. You can also choose whether to enable auto-heal and whether to link the cluster to a Placement Group. Alternatively, you can leave these options at default values.

6. Click **Create a cluster**.

## How to edit a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes Kapsule dashboard displays.

2. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the cluster you want to edit.

3. Choose the option you require:
    * **More info**: See detailed information about the Cluster
    * **Add a pool**: Add additional computing resources to the Cluster
    * **Get kubeconfig**: Download the `.kubeconfig` file of the Cluster
    * **Delete**: Delete the Cluster


## How to delete a Kubernetes Kapsule cluster

1. Click **Kubernetes** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Kubernetes Kapsule dashboard displays.

2. Click <Icon name="more" /> to display the options menu, then click **Delete**. A cluster deletion pop-up displays. 

3. Type **DELETE** to confirm the deletion of your cluster. Tick the checkbox to automatically delete all volumes (including those with volume type “retain”) and load balancers whose names start with cluster ID. Valitate your choice by clicking **Delete this cluster**. 

<Message type="important">
Deleting your cluster will permanently destroy your cluster and all its associated pools and Instances.
