## Environment variables

An environment variable is a variable whose value is set outside the program, typically through functionality built into the operating system or microservice. An environment variable is made up of a name/value pair, and any number may be created and available for reference at a point in time.

## Function
A function defines a procedure on how to change one element into another. The function remains static, while the variables that pass through it can vary.

## Function as a Service (FaaS)

Function as a Service (FaaS) simplifies deploying applications to the cloud. You are only required to install a piece of business logic, a “function,” on any cloud platform. The platform executes the function on demand. Therefore you can focus on backend code without provisioning or maintaining servers. In addition, the platform makes the function available and manages resource allocation for you. For instance, if the system needs to accommodate 100 simultaneous requests, it allocates 100 (or more) copies of your service. Also, if demand drops to two concurrent requests, it destroys the unneeded ones. You pay for the resources your functions use, and only when your functions need them.

## Handler

A handler is a routine/function/method which is specialized in a certain type of data or focused on certain special tasks.

</Concept>

<Concept>

## Namespace

A namespace is a project that allows you to group your functions. In addition, you can store environment variables (configuration setups) which are shared between all functions stored in the namespace’s scope.

</Concept>

## Serverless

Serverless allows you to deploy your Functions (FaaS) and Containerized Applications (CaaS) in a managed infrastructure. Scaleway ensures the deployment, the availability and the scalability of all your projects.

## Trigger

Triggers are a named channel for a class of events. The following are examples of triggers:

- A trigger of location update events.
- A trigger of document uploads to a website.
- A trigger of incoming emails.
