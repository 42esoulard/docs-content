## Alias

An email alias is an additional email address for an email account, with which a user can send and receive emails, or set forwards to. A single user account can have multiple email aliases, with different domains or even with the same domain.

## Cloud Hosting

Cloud hosting uses Scaleway cloud instances for your hosting needs. With this option, you can benefit from all the technologies and features of the cloud. Cloud hosting solutions work with all CMS and PHP frameworks. Storage is via SSD, giving better performance.

## Email Account

An email account is an email address on which mail is stored (unlike an alias / catchall). You can check your mail accounts via two protocols: POP3 and IMAP.

## FTP Account

FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a protocol that allows you to transfer files between different computers over the Internet. It allows you, as part of our web hosting offer, to transfer your files from your computer to Scaleway.com - for example, to do an update of your website. It also works vice-versa: you can recover the files stored on Scaleway.com and transfer them to your personal computer, for example to make a backup.

## Filtering

Filtering allows you to sort your emails depending on different criteria (the sender, the subject, the object and much more). If the email meets one or more criteria you can define different actions (delete the email, move it into a folder, etc).

## Redirection

A redirection is an alternative e-mail address for one or multiple email accounts of the same domain. For example, you can create the alias `contact@example.com` which will redirect the mail to the personal e-mail account `firstname.lastname@example.com`
This allows you to have multiple e-mail addresses without the need to have multiple e-mail accounts. It is also possible to deliver the mail to multiple recipients.
