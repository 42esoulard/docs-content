After the delivery of your server, you can begin installing it.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox Console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have a [Dedibox server](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server)

</Message>

1. From the console, click **Server** > **Server list** on the top menu. A list of your servers displays.

2. Click **Manage** next to the server you want to install. The server install wizard displays.

3. Select the type of operating system you want to install. 
  
  <Message type="tip">

    For more information about OS types, refer to the [dedicated servers concepts page](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/concepts#os-type).

  </Message>

  <Message type="note">

    If you wish to complete your installation using [KVM Over IP](/dedibox/kvm-over-ip/), click **Install over KVM** on this page.

  </Message>

4. Choose the operating system, and the OS version. Then, click **Install**. 

5. Personalize the following [partitioning](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/concepts#partioning) parameters:

    - the file system (ext4, ext3, ext2, xfs, reiserfs, nfts, swap)
    - the mount point of the partition
    - the partition size
    - the software raid (RAID 0/1/5)

  <Message type="note">

    When you start a CentOS installation with custom partitioning, you need to keep about 5 GB of unallocated disk space to prevent the automatic installation system from crashing.

  </Message>

6. Click **Validate**.

7. Configure the system parameters. You can edit parameters such as the name of the server, add a username, password and SSH key, and configure monitoring alerts and updates.

  <Message type="note">

   To connect to your server via SSH, it is recommended that you [create and upload your SSH key](/dedibox-console/my-account/how-to/upload-an-ssh-key) at this stage so that it can be transferred to your server during installation.
   
  </Message>

8. Check that all information you entered is correct on the installation summary tab.

Once the installation completes, your server will reboot on its hard disk.

<Message type="note">

  Depending on the OS, the installation may take several minutes to complete. Certain operating systems may require additional reboots for completion. We recommend waiting 45 to 60 minutes before you connect to your server.
