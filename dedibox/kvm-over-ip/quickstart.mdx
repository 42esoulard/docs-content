Each Bare Metal server provides a dedicated [KVM over IP device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch#KVM_over_IP_(IPKVM)), allowing you to access the keyboard, video, and mouse of the machine remotely. This gives you access to the machine even if the installed OS is not working properly, so that you can debug the system or install your own OS from a remote ISO file.
